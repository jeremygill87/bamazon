# Bamazon
Amazon-style storefront using MySQL and Node.  This app is exactly what you are expecting it to be.

Bamazon connects to a mysql database and maintains all records of inventory there.

## For Customers

This script allows customers to select their product from the catalogue, then the number of items they wish to purchase.  A running tab of total costs is maintained until the user is ready to check out.

Inventory/stock is categorized into departments, for browsing and shopping convenience.

To run as a customer, type this into the terminal:

node bamazonCustomer.js

## For Managers

This script allows managers to view their inventory, identify low-stock products, restock inventory, and add new products.

All changes will be reflected not only in the node terminal, but also in the mysql database.

New products and new departments will be added at the manager's discretion.

To run Bamazon as a manager, type this into the terminal:

node bamazonManager.js

## For Supervisors

Nothing yet.  Kill the rich.  Down with Bezos!  BRING ME HIS HEAD!!

## The Future

With Bezos gone, the e-commerce void is mine to fill.  Soon, I will bend the Internet to my will, by offering free expedited shipping for people with a paid Bamazon account.
